   Case Study Questions

-- A. Customer Journey

-- Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, 
-- -- write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey. Try to keep it as short as possible 
-- -- - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!

select s.customer_id
	, s.start_date
	, p.plan_name
	, p.price
from foodie_fi.subscriptions as s
	join foodie_fi.plans as p on s.plan_id = p.plan_id
where customer_id <= 8;

  
-- B. Data Analysis Questions

-- 1. How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?
-- 2. What is the monthly distribution of trial plan start_date values for our dataset - use the start of the month as the group by value
-- 3. What plan start_date values occur after the year 2020 for our dataset? Show the breakdown by count of events for each plan_name
-- 4. What is the customer count and percentage of customers who have churned rounded to 1 decimal place?
-- 5. How many customers have churned straight after their initial free trial - what percentage is this rounded to the nearest whole number?
-- 6. What is the number and percentage of customer plans after their initial free trial?
-- 7. What is the customer count and percentage breakdown of all 5 plan_name values at 2020-12-31?
-- 8. How many customers have upgraded to an annual plan in 2020?
-- 9. How many days on average does it take for a customer to an annual plan from the day they join Foodie-Fi?
-- 10. Can you further breakdown this average value into 30 day periods (i.e. 0-30 days, 31-60 days etc)
-- 11. How many customers downgraded from a pro monthly to a basic monthly plan in 2020?
